##night
at three in the morning the body
forgets its public name
calls itself by the one it uses at home
raw and unperformed and open

##dawn
the light finds you between
what you were last night
and what you will claim to be
rising into the name they gave you

##morning
now you are the one they expect
assembled and legible
wearing the self that travels
the self that knows the right words

##afternoon
after noon the weight of it
the performance thick as August
you wonder which syllable is you
which is the version you agreed to

##dusk
at the edge of the day
the edges of the you come loose
something slips toward the other self
the one you left back there

##evening
coming back to the dark
setting down the words that were not yours
the clock says one thing
the body says another
